# Lucio
Lucio is a web content extracting module written in Python, it's heavily based on python lxml. It works best on Deep websites (websites that result information based on what you entered) like Amazon, StackOverflow, Ebay,.. 

Given a front page url, Lucio will extract all products/articles links from it (including pagination). Moreover, given a product page, Lucio can extract the product's information such as product's name, publish date, location, author, pricetag, image, rating,.. Lucio can also extract users comment about the product.
